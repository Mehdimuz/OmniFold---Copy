The original dataset corresponding to the studies presented in 1911.09107 can be found at https://zenodo.org/records/3548091. The scripts in this repo should be sufficient to reproduce those data at particle level.  The detector response is slightly different when Delphes 3.5.0 is used instead of 3.4.2.  I used Pythia 8.244 to validate the setup.

Instructions: install Delphes (https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/delphes/wiki/WorkBook/QuickTour and https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/delphes/wiki/WorkBook/Pythia8) and then run the *.py script.
